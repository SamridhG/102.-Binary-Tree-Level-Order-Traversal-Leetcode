# 102.-Binary-Tree-Level-Order-Traversal-Leetcode


Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]


Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]


Example 2:



Input: root = [1]


Output: [[1]]


Example 3:



Input: root = []


Output: []
 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].


-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
